This problem is a little more complex...

For one, I need to account for this taper by just averaging the diameters to find how much water is in the tank.

I will then need to account for that change in height a little differently, which shouldnt be that bad.

Once I get that, I have to create new variables to get the time for more then half of the water is gone.

The table is the same as the last problem but more inserts

I then have to graph the cup and lable the water levels with text to make sure it is reasonable what the data printed and gives a real picture of what it would look like
if i looked at snapshots of the times
