%Study the effects of pressure ratio and maximum temperature on the actual cycle.
%Plots of 
    % efficiency as a function of pressure ratio 
    % efficiency as a function of max temperature 
    
    % increase in kinetic energy as a function of pressure ratio
    % increase in kinetic energy as a funtion of max temperature 

% Make notes / recommendation of pressure ratio and max temp, remember that increasing PR and TMax may change manufacturing cost
